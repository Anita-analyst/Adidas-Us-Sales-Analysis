# Adidas Us Sales Analysis

### Introduction

Adidas is a prominent global brand in sports apparel and footwear, operating in a highly competitive market. To maintain its market share and foster growth, the company must continually analyze its sales performance, customer preferences, and the effectiveness of its marketing strategies. This analysis leverages the Adidas dataset to offer actionable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and marketing performance.
	In this report, I provide a detailed analysis of Adidas sales data using Excel. This personal project aims to improve my data analysis skills by utilizing Excel’s data manipulation and visualization tools to lay bare important insights into sales  performance, trends, and patterns. Join me as I explore the data to highlight valuable information that can inform strategic decision-making and improve business outcomes for Adidas.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

The analysis was conducted using Excel, and I approached it through a structured process outlined below:

1.  Data cleaning:
To ensure the dataset’s quality, I conducted a thorough evaluation focusing on consistency, reliability, completeness, duplicates, and spelling errors. Verification checks were systemically performed, reinforcing the integrity and cleanliness of the data.

2.  Data Analysis:
I employed pivot tables for calculations and aggregations, which proved effective in uncovering valuable insights from the dataset.

3.  Data Visualization:
To effectively communicate the analysis results, I utilized a variety of Excel charts, including those derived from pivot tables. I also incorporated slicers to enhance interactivity and improve the overall usability of the dashboard, making it more accessible for users.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

For this analysis, I will focus on the following key questions to gain deeper insights:
- What is the total sales amount generated by each retailer?
- How does the proportion of sales from each method compare to the overall total sales?
- Which three retailers have made the most significant contributions to total sales?
- What trends can we observe in sales performance over time?

By addressing these questions, we can better understand the sale landscape and identify areas for improvement.

### Recommendation

- Invest in targeted online marketing campaigns, offer competitive pricing, promotions; Implement seamless omnichannel experience and leverage social media and influencer partnership to boost online sales.
- Create a review box for customers to share their experiences with retailers.
- The highest sales were from West Gear store; I would recommend that the store should always have all products in stock during all periods to maximize profit.
- Develop strategies to enhance operations during summer, given its importance for sales. These strategies may include curating product offerings that cater specifically to customers’ needs during this season.
- Continuously monitor sales performance, track key performance indicaors, and gather marketing messages. 

### Conclusion

The analysis of Adidas’s sales data across multiple retailers and products provides valuable insights into market performance and consumer behaviour. By leveraging these insights, Adidas can refine its marketing strategies, enhance product offerings, and ultimately improve sales across its retail network.
